// Package service facilitates communication with IntelÂ® AMT devices to convey the semantics of a Service that is available for the use of a ManagedElement.
//
// An example of an available Service is that a Processor and an enclosure (a PhysicalElement) can use AlertOnLAN Services to signal an incomplete or erroneous boot.
//
// In reality, AlertOnLAN is simply a HostedService on a computer system that is generally available for use and is not a dependency of the processor or enclosure.
//
// To describe that the use of this service might be restricted or have limited availability or applicability, the CIM_ServiceAvailableToElement association would be instantiated between the Service and specific CIM_Processors and CIM_Chassis.
