This organization might be the entity from whom the Element is purchased, but this is not necessarily true. The latter information is contained in the Vendor property of CIM_Product.

The Tag property can contain information such as asset tag or serial number data. The key for PhysicalElement is placed very high in the object hierarchy in order to independently identify the hardware or entity, regardless of physical placement in or on Cabinets, Adapters, and so on. For example, a hotswappable or removable component can be taken from its containing (scoping) Package and be temporarily unused. The object still continues to exist and can even be inserted into a different scoping container. Therefore, the key for Physical Element is an arbitrary string and is defined independently of any placement or location-oriented hierarchy.
		Version           string            `xml:"Version"`           // A string that indicates the version of the PhysicalElement.

// Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail:
//
// - "Stressed" indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of "Stressed" states are overload, overheated, and so on.
//
// - "Predictive Failure" indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future.
//
// - "In Service" describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered.
//
// - "No Contact" indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it.
//
// - "Lost Communication" indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable.
//
// - "Stopped" and "Aborted" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated.
//
// - "Dormant" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced.
//
// - "Supporting Entity in Error" indicates that this element might be "OK" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems.
//
// - "Completed" indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error).
//
// - "Power Mode" indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association.
//
// - "Relocating" indicates the element is being relocated.
//
// OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element.
