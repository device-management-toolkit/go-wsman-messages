In order to ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID SHOULD be constructed using the following 'preferred' algorithm: <OrgID>:<LocalID> Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon ':', and where <OrgID> MUST include a copyrighted, trademarked or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity creating/defining the InstanceID, or is a registered ID that is assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority (This is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness <OrgID> MUST NOT contain a colon (':'). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID MUST appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. <LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and SHOULD not be re-used to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If the above 'preferred' algorithm is not used, the defining entity MUST assure that the resultant InstanceID is not re-used across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for this instance's NameSpace. For DMTF defined instances, the 'preferred' algorithm MUST be used with the <OrgID> set to 'CIM'.
		VersionString string   `xml:"VersionString"` // A string representing the complete software version information - for example, '12.1(3)T'.  This string and the numeric major/minor/revision/build properties are complementary. Since vastly different representations and semantics exist for versions, it is not assumed that one representation is sufficient to permit a client to perform computations (i.e., the values are numeric) and a user to recognize the software's version (i.e., the values are understandable and readable). Hence, both numeric and string representations of version are provided.
		IsEntity      bool     `xml:"IsEntity"`      // The IsEntity property is used to indicate whether the SoftwareIdentity corresponds to a discrete copy of the software component or is being used to convey descriptive and identifying information about software that is not present in the management domain.A value of TRUE shall indicate that the SoftwareIdentity instance corresponds to a discrete copy of the software component. A value of FALSE shall indicate that the SoftwareIdentity instance does not correspond to a discrete copy of the Software.
