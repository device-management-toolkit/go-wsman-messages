This property allows each instance to define a user-friendly name in addition to its key properties, identity data, and description information. Note that the Name property of ManagedSystemElement is also defined as a user-friendly name. But, it is often subclassed to be a Key. It is not reasonable that the same property can convey both identity and a user-friendly name, without inconsistencies. Where Name exists and is not a Key (such as for instances of LogicalDevice), the same information can be present in both the Name and ElementName properties. Note that if there is an associated instance of CIM_EnabledLogicalElementCapabilities, restrictions on this properties may exist as defined in ElementNameMask and MaxElementNameLen properties defined in that class.

	//EnabledState is an integer enumeration that indicates the enabled and disabled states of an element. It can also indicate the transitions between these requested states. For example, shutting down (value=4) and starting (value=10) are transient states between enabled and disabled. The following text briefly summarizes the various enabled and disabled states:
	// Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests.
	//
	// Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests.
	//
	// Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state.
	//
	// Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled.
	//
	// Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests.
	//
	// Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state.
	//
	// Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests.
	//
	// Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The behavior of the element is similar to the Enabled state, but it processes only a restricted set of commands. All other requests are queued.
	//
	// Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued.
	//
	// The supported values are 32768-32771.
