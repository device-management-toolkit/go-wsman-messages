// EnabledState is an integer enumeration that indicates the enabled and disabled states of an element. It can also indicate the transitions between these requested states. For example, shutting down (value=4) and starting (value=10) are transient states between enabled and disabled. The following text briefly summarizes the various enabled and disabled states:
//
// Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests.
//
// Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests.
//
// Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state.
//
// Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled.
//
// Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests.
//
// Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state.
//
// Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests.
//
// Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode. The behavior of the element is similar to the Enabled state, but it processes only a restricted set of commands. All other requests are queued.
//
// Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued.
