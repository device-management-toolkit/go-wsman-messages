This property allows each instance to define a user-friendly name in addition to its key properties, identity data, and description information. Note that the Name property of ManagedSystemElement is also defined as a user-friendly name. But, it is often subclassed to be a Key. It is not reasonable that the same property can convey both identity and a user-friendly name, without inconsistencies. Where Name exists and is not a Key (such as for instances of LogicalDevice), the same information can be present in both the Name and ElementName properties.

If there is no Log header, then this property should be set to 0. Headers may include general information about the Log such as the current number of records, time of last update, or a pointer to the location of the first Log entry. Note that this property is NOT the size of the header for an individual Log entry. The latter is described by the property, SizeOfRecordHeader.
		SizeOfRecordHeader     int                 `xml:"SizeOfRecordHeader"`     // The size of the header for the Log's individual entries, in bytes, if record headers are defined. If there are no record headers, then this property should be set to 0. Record headers may include information such as the type of the Log entry, the date/time that the entry was last updated, or a pointer to the start of optional data. Note that this property defines the header size for individual records in the Log, while the SizeOfHeader property describes the Log's overall header, typically located at the start of the MessageLog.

	// EnabledState is an integer enumeration that indicates the enabled and disabled states of an element. It can also indicate the transitions between these requested states. For example, shutting down (value=4) and starting (value=10) are transient states between enabled and disabled.
	//

	//
	// - Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests.

	EnabledState int

	// Indicates the current health of the element. This attribute expresses the health of this element but not necessarily that of its subcomponents. The possible values are 0 to 30, where 5 means the element is entirely healthy and 30 means the element is completely non-functional.
	//
	// The following continuum is defined:
	//
	// - "Non-recoverable Error" (30) - The element has completely failed, and recovery is not possible. All functionality provided by this element has been lost.
	//
	// - "Critical Failure" (25) - The element is non-functional and recovery might not be possible.
	//
	// - "Major Failure" (20) - The element is failing. It is possible that some or all of the functionality of this component is degraded or not working.
	//
	// - "Minor Failure" (15) - All functionality is available but some might be degraded.
	//
	// - "Degraded/Warning" (10) - The element is in working order and all functionality is provided. However, the element is not working to the best of its abilities. For example, the element might not be operating at optimal performance or it might be reporting recoverable errors.
	//
	// - "OK" (5) - The element is fully functional and is operating within normal operational parameters and without error.
	//
	// - "Unknown" (0) - The implementation cannot report on HealthState at this time.
	//
	// DMTF has reserved the unused portion of the continuum for additional HealthStates in the future.

	HealthState int

	// Indicates the current statuses of the element. Various operational statuses are defined. Many of the enumeration's values are self-explanatory. However, a few are not and are described here in more detail:
	//
	// - "Stressed" indicates that the element is functioning, but needs attention. Examples of "Stressed" states are overload, overheated, and so on.
	//
	// - "Predictive Failure" indicates that an element is functioning nominally but predicting a failure in the near future.
	//
	// - "In Service" describes an element being configured, maintained, cleaned, or otherwise administered.
	//
	// - "No Contact" indicates that the monitoring system has knowledge of this element, but has never been able to establish communications with it.
	//
	// - "Lost Communication" indicates that the ManagedSystem Element is known to exist and has been contacted successfully in the past, but is currently unreachable.
	//
	// - "Stopped" and "Aborted" are similar, although the former implies a clean and orderly stop, while the latter implies an abrupt stop where the state and configuration of the element might need to be updated.
	//
	// - "Dormant" indicates that the element is inactive or quiesced.
	//
	// - "Supporting Entity in Error" indicates that this element might be "OK" but that another element, on which it is dependent, is in error. An example is a network service or endpoint that cannot function due to lower-layer networking problems.
	//
	// - "Completed" indicates that the element has completed its operation. This value should be combined with either OK, Error, or Degraded so that a client can tell if the complete operation Completed with OK (passed), Completed with Error (failed), or Completed with Degraded (the operation finished, but it did not complete OK or did not report an error).
	//
	// - "Power Mode" indicates that the element has additional power model information contained in the Associated PowerManagementService association.
	//
	// - "Relocating" indicates the element is being relocated.
	//
	// OperationalStatus replaces the Status property on ManagedSystemElement to provide a consistent approach to enumerations, to address implementation needs for an array property, and to provide a migration path from today's environment to the future. This change was not made earlier because it required the deprecated qualifier. Due to the widespread use of the existing Status property in management applications, it is strongly recommended that providers or instrumentation provide both the Status and OperationalStatus properties. Further, the first value of OperationalStatus should contain the primary status for the element. When instrumented, Status (because it is single-valued) should also provide the primary status of the element.

	OperationalStatus int

	// RequestedState is an integer enumeration that indicates the last requested or desired state for the element, irrespective of the mechanism through which it was requested. The actual state of the element is represented by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states.
	//
	// Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ("Not Applicable"), then this property has no meaning. Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration. "Unknown" (0) indicates the last requested state for the element is unknown.
	//
	// Note that the value "No Change" (5) has been deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is "Unknown" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState should have the value "Unknown" (0), but may have the value "No Change" (5).  Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState. It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are "Reboot" (10) and "Reset" (11). Reboot refers to doing a "Shut Down" and then moving to an "Enabled" state. Reset indicates that the element is first "Disabled" and then "Enabled". The distinction between requesting "Shut Down" and "Disabled" should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests. This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code. If knowledge of the last RequestedState is not supported for the EnabledLogicalElement, the property shall be NULL or have the value 12 "Not Applicable".
