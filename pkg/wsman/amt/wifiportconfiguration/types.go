	// RequestedState is an integer enumeration that indicates the last requested or desired state for the element, irrespective of the mechanism through which it was requested. The actual state of the element is represented by EnabledState. This property is provided to compare the last requested and current enabled or disabled states. Note that when EnabledState is set to 5 ("Not Applicable"), then this property has no meaning. Refer to the EnabledState property description for explanations of the values in the RequestedState enumeration.
	//
	// "Unknown" (0) indicates the last requested state for the element is unknown.
	//
	// Note that the value "No Change" (5) has been deprecated in lieu of indicating the last requested state is "Unknown" (0). If the last requested or desired state is unknown, RequestedState should have the value "Unknown" (0), but may have the value "No Change" (5).Offline (6) indicates that the element has been requested to transition to the Enabled but Offline EnabledState.
	//
	// It should be noted that there are two new values in RequestedState that build on the statuses of EnabledState. These are "Reboot" (10) and "Reset" (11). Reboot refers to doing a "Shut Down" and then moving to an "Enabled" state. Reset indicates that the element is first "Disabled" and then "Enabled". The distinction between requesting "Shut Down" and "Disabled" should also be noted. Shut Down requests an orderly transition to the Disabled state, and might involve removing power, to completely erase any existing state. The Disabled state requests an immediate disabling of the element, such that it will not execute or accept any commands or processing requests.
	//
	// This property is set as the result of a method invocation (such as Start or StopService on CIM_Service), or can be overridden and defined as WRITEable in a subclass. The method approach is considered superior to a WRITEable property, because it allows an explicit invocation of the operation and the return of a result code.

	// EnabledState is an integer enumeration that indicates the enabled and disabled states of an element. It can also indicate the transitions between these requested states. For example, shutting down (value=4) and starting (value=10) are transient states between enabled and disabled. The following text briefly summarizes the various enabled and disabled states:
	//
	// Enabled (2) indicates that the element is or could be executing commands, will process any queued commands, and queues new requests.
	//
	// Disabled (3) indicates that the element will not execute commands and will drop any new requests.
	//
	// Shutting Down (4) indicates that the element is in the process of going to a Disabled state.
	//
	// Not Applicable (5) indicates the element does not support being enabled or disabled.
	//
	// Enabled but Offline (6) indicates that the element might be completing commands, and will drop any new requests.
	//
	// Test (7) indicates that the element is in a test state.
	//
	// Deferred (8) indicates that the element might be completing commands, but will queue any new requests.
	//
	// Quiesce (9) indicates that the element is enabled but in a restricted mode.
	//
	// Starting (10) indicates that the element is in the process of going to an Enabled state. New requests are queued.
	//

The possible values are 0 to 30, where 5 means the element is entirely healthy and 30 means the element is completely non-functional. The following continuum is defined:
	//
	// "Non-recoverable Error" (30) - The element has completely failed, and recovery is not possible. All functionality provided by this element has been lost.
	//
	// "Critical Failure" (25) - The element is non-functional and recovery might not be possible.
	//
	// "Major Failure" (20) - The element is failing. It is possible that some or all of the functionality of this component is degraded or not working.
	//
	// "Minor Failure" (15) - All functionality is available but some might be degraded.
	//
	// "Degraded/Warning" (10) - The element is in working order and all functionality is provided. However, the element is not working to the best of its abilities. For example, the element might not be operating at optimal performance or it might be reporting recoverable errors.
	//
	// "OK" (5) - The element is fully functional and is operating within normal operational parameters and without error.
	//
	// "Unknown" (0) - The implementation cannot report on HealthState at this time.
